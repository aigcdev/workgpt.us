                The Services allow you to integrate and create actions or commands between various

                account with each third-party application you integrate, and the Services will
                require you to authenticate with each application. We will store the login
                credentials for each third-party application that you authenticate to allow us to
                continue to provide the Services. When you enable the Services, the third-party
                applications you integrate will provide us with access to the information you
                provided to the third-party application. When you integrate third-party

                the third-party application and any data or content contained within the third-party
                application required to affect the action or command. The third-party application
                will share information with us, and we will share information between third-party
                applications. We are not responsible for how any third-party application collects,
